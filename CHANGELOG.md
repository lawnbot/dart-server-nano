# 1.5.2

- Update dependencies and dart sdk

# 1.5.1

- Small performance adjustments

# 1.5.0

- Added capability to run websockets servers in main thread. Although it is not recommended to manipulate sockets outside of their scope, there is now this possibility, running the websockets server on the main thread. The default behavior is still to use isolates for everything, however if you need to you can change this using: `useWebsocketInMainThread: true` in the listen function. Note: in mobile applications, using websockets in the main thread can cause UI freezes when a large amount of data is being sent or received. The default behavior uses isolates to avoid this problem. Change this behavior only if you know what you are doing.

# 1.4.0

- Improve error handling
- Base websockets rooms in my RelationalMap implementation, that is less error prone and more efficient (a lot more efficient in fact)
- Separate the websocket server from the http server. You should select two different ports for each one now (`port` and `wsPort`), it is a way more performant and scalable approach. Note: You can use the old approach by setting the serverMode: ServerMode.compatibility in the listen function, but it is not recommended.
- Add a new method `broadcastEventToRoom` that sends a message to all clients in a room except the sender
- Update benchmarks to reflect the new changes (it is a little bit faster now)
